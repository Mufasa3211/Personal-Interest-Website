                        Volleyball is one of the skills that I have and one of the most games that I love playing, to be fair, I actually stopped playing it but then I went to the YMCA and I played it, I was not good at all. It's like my skills faded away. But this is not the end! I still love the game and I'm planning to play it again and get better even more than I used to be. By joining a club. But not any club, I will join the GCI volleyball club because I don't have to go somewhere far or anything. I can just stay in the school more than usual so I can improve my skills and perhaps challenge other schools and win them! I always wanted to do that from the beginning, I'm working on it! The first time I played Volleyball was in grade 8 (I'm in grade 10 right now) and it was a nice game, and this is where I kept playing it more and more, I improved my serve and my playing skills to the better but when it was the vacation I stopped playing it and then when it was grade 9. I still didn't play Volleyball at all. And on the summer vacation, in the end. I went to the YMCA and played Volleyball there and I didn't do good at all. But I will keep practicing until I become better than before!
