                    <p class="centertext"> Welcome back to my website! Today's topic is going to be hobbies! I love hobbies so much because I like to learn new things. We will go through only three main hobbies that I love doing, first, is playing ping pong or also known as table tennis. It's sort of an old game and it's also popular. I'm thinking of joining a club just for table tennis to enhance my skills and get better at it. The second hobby is Rubik's cube. Some people have never been able to solve it. Some people have been able to solve it but with help. Sometimes people just give up and never thought of solving it again. But honestly, I like to solve it and with speed. I can solve the Rubik's cube in under 20 seconds which is good if you think about it! Last but not least, I like playing Volleyball, to be fair I stopped playing it for a while but I used to be so good. I'm planning once clubs are back open in GCI I will join the Volleyball club. It's so fun and I love it. This is everything, for now, I don't want to go into details because this will ruin your experience! Have a great day reading discovering about me! </p>
