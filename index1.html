                    <p class="centertext"> Table Tennis is one of the games that I love so much because it requires speed to respond to the ball and I love speed games. I'm planning to join a club soon or later so I can enhance my skills and perhaps join tournaments and win games! Table tennis is a special sport because it's like tennis but on a table. You don't have to run a lot or at least as much as playing normal tennis, another thing is you have to learn something called spin. Spinning the ball in table tennis is super important because it gets your playing to the next level, and to have a good spin you need two things. The first one is practicing and the second one is having good tools. If you don't have good tools then you can't make spin at all or just make a little that it's even considered as having zero spins! The posture is a very important thing to enhance your skills more and get better. Without it, you won't get effective shots and you will end up losing. The best place to improve everything and lots more are clubs. Clubs are a very good way to improve your skills with speed and get into tournaments in no time.
